In order to run the project make sure you have node_modules installed 
    npm install

You need at least Node.js 16.14.2 in order to run the commands, so if you are getting issues run 
    nvm install 16.14.2 

If the Express.js and node-postgres (pg) dependencies aren't installed, run 
    npm i express pg

To actually test everything you'll need to attach a database. See the first part of this link in order to do sto:
